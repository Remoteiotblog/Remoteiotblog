This could include combining multiple types of connectivity, such as cellular, Wi-Fi, and satellite, to ensure that devices can switch to a backup connection when primary networks fail.</p>
<p data-start="5207" data-end="5528">In some cases, local storage and edge computing can be used to process and store data when the device is offline. This allows devices to continue functioning and collecting data even in the absence of an active network connection. Once the device reconnects to the network, data can be synchronized automatically.</p>
<h3 data-start="5530" data-end="5568">5. Device Lifecycle Management</h3>
<p data-start="5569" data-end="5815">IoT devices have a finite lifespan, and managing their lifecycle&mdash;from deployment to decommissioning&mdash;can be challenging. Devices need to be properly maintained, updated, and eventually replaced to prevent them from becoming obsolete or vulnerable.</p>
<p data-start="5817" data-end="6059">Without effective lifecycle management, devices can end up underperforming, contributing to inefficiencies or security risks. Additionally, improper disposal of devices can lead to data breaches if sensitive information is not properly wiped.</p>
